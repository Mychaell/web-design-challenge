## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do these challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS**

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

Include social media icons and links to your personal social media profiles.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

You are expected to publish your finished work using GitHub Pages. Find out more about GitHub Pages here: [https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com).

## Sharing your solution

1. Submit the link to your work in a file titled 'solution.md' and project files(html,css, javascript) in a folder titled 'your full name' 

2. Submit a pull request using front-end folder in https://github.com/paritie/pre-bootcamp2-submission 

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
